# Description 

OOP game created using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 

The game, titled 'I WANT TO BE HUMAN!', challenges you to collect falling body parts in order to make yourself into a fully-fledged human person...

# Instructions to play

- You have a 1-minute time limit to collect your body parts.
- You can use the left & right arrow keys to move, & the return button to jump (if you are super eager to get those body parts, this is a good option).
- One more thing. To collect body parts, follow this order: right arm, right leg, left arm, left leg, and finally, the head.
- Falling axes take away your limbs.
